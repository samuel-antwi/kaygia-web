## üìù Architecture & Development Guidelines

We follow these principles in our component architecture:

1. **Small, Modular Components:**

   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Aim for components under 150 lines of code
   - Break large page components into smaller, reusable pieces

2. **Component Organization:**

   - Group related components in dedicated directories
   - Follow consistent naming conventions for component files
   - Create index files to simplify imports when appropriate

3. **Code Reusability:**

   - Extract shared logic into composables
   - Create reusable UI components for common patterns
   - Avoid code duplication across similar components

4. **Component Structure:**
   - Follow the standard template: script setup with TypeScript, then template, then scoped styles
   - Organize script section in a consistent order (imports, types, props, emits, etc.)
   - Keep templates clean and readable with proper indentation
